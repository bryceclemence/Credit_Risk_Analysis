# Credit_Risk_Analysis


### Purpose
The Purpose of this analysis was to predict credit risk using various available algorithms, then evaluating their performance of the models created, and give a recommendation
on which model should be used.



### Results
The results of the oversampling model were;
- The balanced accuracy score was 65.7%
- The average precision rate was 99%
- The recall rate was 60%

The results of the SMOTE model were;
- The balanced accurancy score was 65.7%
- The precision rate was 99%
- The recall rate was 60%

The results of the undersampling model were;
- The balanced accurancy score was 65.7%
- The precision rate was 99%
- The recall rate was 60%

The results of the combined sampling model were;
- The balanced accurancy score was 64.0%
- The precision rate was 99%
- The recall rate was 58%

The results of the Balanced Random Forest Classifier model were;
- The balanced accurancy score was 78.9%
- The precision rate was 99%
- The recall rate was 87%

The results of the Easy Ensemble Classifier model were;
- The balanced accurancy score was 93.2%
- The precision rate was 99%
- The recall rate was 94%


### Conclusion

From this analysis we can conclude that the Easy Ensemble Classifier model was the most successful in predicting credit risk, with an accuracy score of 93.2%.
